# 🧑‍🎓 Biography

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by [Prof. Hai Zhao](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=60), majoring in Computer Science. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Central South University in 2021.

My research focuses on improving the **Efficiency** of large language models, including but not limited to model pruning, efficient training, and KV cache optimization.
